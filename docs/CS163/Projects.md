Here is a curated and slightly edited collection of programming projects that are assigned to computer science students at Portland State University.

Many PSU CS programming courses typically post 5 assignments through the 10 week term. So you can estimate when an assignment was posted by its number. For example a HW3, would likely have been posted about midway through the term.


  * CS161: Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving
    *

  * CS162 Introduction to Computer Science:
    *

  * CS163 Data Structures
    *

  * CS201 Computer Systems Programming
    * [HW1: Typing Speed Game](Projects/Typing_Speed_Game.html)
    * [HW3: Decryption](Projects/Decryption.html)

  * CS 202
    *

  * CS 311
    * [HW1: DFA Analyzer](Projects/DFA_Analyzer.html)
    * [HW2: Simple Grammar Analyzer](Projects/Simple_Grammar_Analyzer.html)
