Binary Search Tree Implementation
------
[LLL Practice Code is here](LLLPracticeCode.html)
[BST Practice Code is up!](BSTPracticeCode.html)

Let's practice implementing linear linked list recursive functions this week. See [Week 4](Week4.html) notes for binary search tree material. We will think about and implement recursive functions for BSTs.
