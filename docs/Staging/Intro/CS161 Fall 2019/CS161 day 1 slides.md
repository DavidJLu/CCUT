## A brief history of Computing
(1820-1840s)
Charles Babbage came up with the idea for a mechanical computer
Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program

<!-- slide data-background-color=#000000 -->
(1936)
Alan Turing invents the Turing Machine
He helps crack the German secret codes during World War II

<!-- slide data-background-color=#000000 -->
(late 1930s) Programmable mechanical computers like the Z1 here

(1945) Computer architecture

(late 1940s)

First digital computers like this Univac

<!-- slide -->
Digital computers only understand the language of binary digits, 0 and 1, called **machine code**.
(1940s Machine and Assembly; 1950s High Level Languages)
(Fortran: 1954)
(Lisp: 1958)
(COBOL: 1960)

(1973) C is invented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie and they write the Unix operating system in C

(1985) C++ is invented by Bjarne Stroustrup

(1991) Python is invented and is now one of the most widely used programming languages

### What is Computer Science?
- Problem solving: general strategies to solve any kind of problem.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

- Logic: methods for precise thinking<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

- Data:  modeling information about the real world inside a computer<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

- Systems: design and build complex systems that satisfy a set of requirements and constraints?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

- **Thinking**: artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing are at the forefront of not only computer science, but also biology, psychology, philosophy, and mathematics.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

<!-- slide -->
Note that the previous list does not contain programming.

Programming is just a tool. But it is a very important tool to understand and be able to use early on in your computer science studies.

<!-- slide -->
Programming, or writing code, is how you instruct a computer to perform some actions.

<!-- slide -->
![](IntroProgramming.jpg)

<!-- slide -->
All of programming is based on the principles of computer science we discussed above.

Logic, algorithms, data, systems engineering are used to build everything from the web browser that these slides are being presented in to the autopilot software on an airplane.

<!-- slide -->
Although programming involves lots of math and structure, it is also a very **creative** exercise

Program idea: Write a python program that tells you whether a number is odd or even

<!-- slide -->
Review:

* Output
```py
print("Hello")
```

* Input
```py
x = input("Type something in\n")
print(x)
```

<!-- slide -->
* Variables
```py
x = 5
y = 6
z = x + y
print(z)
```

* Data Types
(int, float, str)

* Lists
```py
games = ['dota', 'starcraft', 'overwatch']
print(games)
```
