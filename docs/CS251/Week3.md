Argument Validity <a id="validity"></a>
===========
Logic is in the business of evaluating arguments. We study logic to discover (or build) methods for precisely sorting good from bad arguments.

An argument is a line of reasoning that takes us from some assumptions to a conclusion. Take for instance the following argument:

  > It is raining heavily.
  > If you do not take an umbrella, you will get soaked.
  > So, you should take an umbrella

More precisely, an argument is a set of sentences of which one is called the *conclusion* and the others are called the *premises*. Often arguments in natural language omit some premises which are obvious or implied by context. The argument above omits the premise that you don't want to get soaked.
