# DFA Exercises
----

Prove that the following languages are regular by constructing a DFA that recognizes them.

* $L_1$ = $\{s | s$ is a binary representation of a multiple of 5$\}$, $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$
* $L_2$ = $\{s | s$ contains an odd number of 1s and an odd number of 0s$\}$, $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$
* $L_3$ = $\{s | s$ contains three conscutive 1s$\}$, $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$
* $L_4$ = $\{s | s$'s tenth symbol from the left end is a $1\}$, $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$
* $L_5$ = $\{s | s$ is an even number represented in base 3$\}$, $\Sigma = \{0, 1, 2\}$
* $L_6$ = $\{s | s$ contains an even number of $0$s or exactly three $1$s$\}$, $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$
