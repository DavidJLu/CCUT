#CS250 at CCUT Week 1 Day 2: Relations

You should have had an introduction to set theory by now. Let's do a quick recap and take a look at the next topic: relations.


### Introduction to Relations

Let $A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_k\}$ and $B = \{b_1, b_2, ..., b_m\}$

Recall that a **Cartesian product** $A \times B$ is defined by a set of pairs $\{(a_1, b_1), (a_1, b_2), ..., (a_1, b_m), ..., (a_k, b_m)\}$.

A **Cartesian product** defines a product set, or a set of all ordered arrangements of elements in sets in the Cartesian product.

#### Binary relations
Definition: Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets. A binary relation from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of a Cartesian product $A \times B$.
