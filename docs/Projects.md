Here is a curated and slightly edited collection of programming projects that are assigned to computer science students at Portland State University.

Many PSU CS programming courses typically post 5 assignments through the 10 week term. So you can estimate when an assignment was posted by its number. For example a HW3, would likely have been posted about midway through the term.
